== CodenCoffee

This is the Rails app which runs CodenCoffee.org[http://codencoffee.org]. Code & Coffee is a series of informal gatherings among like-minded coders who love coffee.Starting in Seattle, we hope to spread Code & Coffee anywhere coders drink coffee.

Attend our official Meetups, or broadcast your own Code & Coffee to other members of the Code and Coffee community at any time on CodenCoffee.org[http://codencoffee.org].

If you see a bug or opportunity for improvement, please feel free to submit issues and/or send over a pull request.
